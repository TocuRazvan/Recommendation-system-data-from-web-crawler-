# Recommendation-system-data-from-web-crawler
IMDB (Internet Movie Database), a very popular and well-known site, provides comprehensive information on movies, TV shows, actors, directors and other areas of the film industry. Although IMDB offers a wealth of information, it is usually seen as a chaotic place where it can be difficult to find the specific information you need and form a firm opinion about a particular film[2].

This shortcoming of IMDB is addressed by my Python and crawler-based movie recommendation project, which provides a quick way to find the right movies[2]. We can get data from multiple sources, analyze it, and include it in our recommendation system using our crawler.
The crawler gets crucial information about films, such as titles, directors, actors, ratings and other important details, from trusted resources like IMDB[12]. This data is then used to create a complete and up-to-date database. Our crawler can access data from other websites and analyse it, giving us a more comprehensive and varied picture of the film industry[13].
By using our solution, you can avoid the difficulty of wading through the voluminous amount of data available on IMDB. Our recommendation engine sorts and selects acceptable films according to your preferences and areas of interest. You don't have to manually scroll through every title on IMDB to find new movies that appeal to you[15]A distinct, interactive experience is another feature of our product. You can enter your favorite movies through the interface made with the Tkinter toolkit, and the program will then produce personalized recommendations. As a result, you spend less time searching for and choosing the right videos, and the project becomes more valuable and useful[R7].
In conclusion, my movie recommendation project, together with the integrated crawler, provides an efficient and useful solution to overcome the difficulties encountered when searching and selecting movies on IMDB. Python and its specialized crawling libraries allowed us to develop a system that extracts and processes information from multiple sources and integrates it into an up-to-date database. This allows our users to benefit from personalised recommendations, saving time and making their experience
